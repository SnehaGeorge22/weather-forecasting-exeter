The most unforgettable aspect of Exeter is its pleasant weather, paired with the intriguing unpredictability of its climate—one moment it’s sunny, and just five minutes later, it starts pouring,
often reminding us that we’ve left our umbrella at home. The geo spatial aspect of the Exeter
City with the rolling hills along the coastline contributes to the micro-climatic variations resulting in unpredictability. Even though there are technological advancements to accurately predict
the local weather, predicting extreme, localized events like storms and sudden snowfall remains a
significant challenge. Addressing this gap will help the people to prepare themselves for the unpredictable weather. Hence resulting in the research question which is addressed in this coursework:
**"How can local weather, specifically the probability of precipitation in Exeter, UK,
be forecasted through the analysis of historical data?"**
